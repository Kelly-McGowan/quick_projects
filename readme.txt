This repository is split into datasets based on industry, 
within these folders are questions answered by data analysis

Industries with refernces to the data souces I used are:
        Education - https://
        Agriculture - https://
        Healthcare - https://
        Construction - https://
        Hospitality - https://
        Manufacturing - https://
        Pharmacutical - https://
        Energy - https://

Each folder will have numbered files(.py, .ipynb, etc) that will address 
a specific question that can span multiple files. On these occasions there will
be a file named contents.txt that summarises the questions and solutions for the specific dataset


Each question will have one of each of the following from each category:

                    
                    1. Analysis - 8 (Seasonality, Forecasting, Descriptive Analytics, EDA, Decomposition, 
                                     Curve fitting, Trend, Fraud Detection)
                    2. Algorithm - 6 (Ridge Regression, SVM regression, Linear regression, SVM classification,
                                      Decision trees classification, naive bayes)
                    4. Output - 6, 2 (pipeline, powerpoint presentation, executive report, spreadsheet, 
                               technical documentation (stakeholders, general population),
                               non-technical documentation (stakeholders, general population))
